# Noggin

Loggin' for your noggin. It's frustrating to use right now and needs lots of love.

## Write
Noggin stores your notes in a local SQLite db and gives you CRUD functionality.

## Develop
Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) and Rust
```
1. cd ./src
2. yarn install
3. yarn export
4. yarn dev
```
In another terminal 
```
1. cd ./src-tauri
2. yarn tauri dev
```

## I just want to try it out
Download one of the releases!

## What's next?
We're working on:
- Tagging
- Search and Replace
- Hotkeys, Gestures, and Shortcuts
- iCloud Sync

Enjoy your new native Markdown editor in Rust!
