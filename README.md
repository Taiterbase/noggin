# Next.js Web Template
This is a layout driven app powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs). Using this opinionated layout allows for more organized and data-driven applications.


### Ready.. Set.. Go!
I use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) for package management and orchestration. 

```
1. git clone https://github.com/Taiterbase/nextjs-web-template.git
2. cd nextjs-web-template
3. yarn install
4. yarn build
5. yarn start
```

### Great. What else?
First, you should open up the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) in another tab and look through some of the basic features. This app doesn't use all of them, but they're all important and awesome and special, just like you.

Another important and special and awesome page to have opened is the [class list](https://tailwind.build/classes) for the Tailwindcss style classes.

Moving along! For a database solution, I like using Cockroach Labs' [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) with the [node-postgres driver](https://node-postgres.com/features/connecting). 

### Blast-off!
For launching and hosting, [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs) is great for quick deployments.
